There are many different ways we can extract keywords from a text using both heuristic, or rules-based, and ML-based approaches. There are three different methods in this app: TF-IDF, Graph-Based, and KeyBERT. Paste in three different texts below or use the ones provided. Play with the different approaches.

TF-IDF stands for Term-Frequency, Inverse-Document Frequency. It is the standard algorithm used by most search engines today. It is considered a rules-based approach because the algorithm was created by man and does not require training to hone its parameters. On this app, you can control several parameters of the TF-IDF algorithm:

* Max Features => This is the quantity of words the algorithm is allowed to accept.
* N-Gram Range (Low) => The minimum size of words (i.e. machine_learning would be considered 2-grams)
* N-Gram Range (High) => The maximum size of a gram, or words.

**THE N-GRAM (HIGH) MUST! BE HIGHER THAN THE LOW**

Graph-based is slightly different
