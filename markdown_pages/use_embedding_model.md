On this page of the app, you can use the word embedding model that you already created. If you have not created a model yet, pleae do so before moving to this section of the app. You can do so on the "Word Embeddings - Create Model" page. Follow the instructions and then return here.

Once your model is trained, it will automatically load here. Below, you will see two different sections. The Vocabulary expander will show you the model's vocabulary as a list of words. Beneath that, you can explore this vocabulary. Select one of the words from your model's vocabulary and hit "Run Search". After a few seconds, it will populate the results below. On the left, you can see the shape of your vector and on the right you will see the most similar words. Try this process with several different models trained on different corpora of differing sizes. You will notice that the more domain-specific the textual data in the corpus and the larger the corpus, the better your model's precision will be with regards to identifying words that are most similar.
